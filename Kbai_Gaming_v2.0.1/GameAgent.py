        This is the main driver of the agent. The game controller will call this with an updated game object
        every time the agent is expected to make a move.

        The agent will return a Tuple(int, int) for Tic Tac Toe
        or just an int for all Connect Four games.

        TIC TAC TOE:
        Return a tuple in row, column form. (row, col)
        Returning (-1,-1) will make a random selection of available positions.

        Both Row and Column begin at index 0.
        A typical Tic-Tac-Toe board is laid out such that 0,0 is upper left corner.

        Example Board:
        0,0  0,1  0,2
        1,0  1,1  1,2
        2,0  2,1  2,2


        CONNECT FOUR:
        Return an integer representing the column to drop the token into (no row is needed only the column)
        Returning -1 will make a random selection of available positions.

        The Column begins at index 0.
        A typical Connect Four board is laid out such that columns 0 starts on the left side of the play field.
        As new pieces are added, they will start filling columns from the lowest position in the column.

        Example Board
           | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
           |   |   |   | Y | Y |   |   |
           | R |   | Y | R | R |   |   |


        Remember each game type requires a different output '(int, int)' or 'int'
